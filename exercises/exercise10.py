# Story book!
# Create a dictionary with 3 stories inside! like a book :)
# each story should be it's own dictionary with:
    # beggining, middle, end
    # hero
# Iterate over the the book, and print out each story! PRINT ALL of them :)
# Formatted of course
# hints:
 # you already built a dictionary with a story
 # You already have something to prompt user for input & build dictionaries
 # Now what we want is to create a book that hold 3 stories

# extra:
 # stick it in a while loop so we continue to listen to stories :)
 # It would be nice to be able to read only one story
