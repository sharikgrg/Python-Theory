# Assigning a variable
box_variable = 'Books and Stuff'

# looking inside the box
print(box_variable)

# Re-assigning a Variable
# Variable are mutable, hence they can change/be re-assigned
box_variable = "CD's and other stuff"

print(box_variable)
# Re-assigning with a integer
box_variable = 14
print(box_variable)

# Important Python Commands

print('hello', 'yo') # Overloading with two arguments
print(box_variable) # Printing Variable

# type(arg)
# output the data type of an object
print(type('hello'))
print(type(14))
print(type(14.0))
Variable_num = '14'
# print(type('10'*Variable_num)) # This will break
